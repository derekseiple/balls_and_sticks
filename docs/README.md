This is an easy use directory to quickly get to all of the topics below.

TODO make this section more clear!

We have to make decisions on the scale that we want this to have (ie how big should a hydrogen atom be). We want to
be able to use molecular scale units (ie pm or Ã…) when dealing with the atoms and molecules, but we also want to be able
to say how big in the real-wold we want them to be. For that we will need to define a scale factor that can be set.
We can't just simply scale _everything_ in the model though. We want to try and use lego pin connectors to attach all of
the atoms together so the cannot scale they would need to be the same size regardless. (We still have to test whether
those pins will work well or not. It may be better to create our own pins and then we don't have to concern ourselves
with the fixed size relative to the scaled size.)
