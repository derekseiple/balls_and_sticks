 * care how big it is. Instead of trying to assign a value that is big enough in each case we want to define a value
 * that will be larger than anything we will be dealing with. At the same time we don't want the value too big, because
 * OpenScad does not render as nice for values that are too big. Since everything made in this project will be 3D
 * printed, and because my 3D printer has a maximum print length of about 6in I will set INF to be about an order of
 * magnitude bigger

 * factor so that the Van der Waals radius of hydrogen is 9mm in real-world scale. That is 120*pm == 9,
