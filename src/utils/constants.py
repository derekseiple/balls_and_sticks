In many models we want some notion of infinity. For example we may want to cut out a component and we don't
care how big it is. Instead of trying to assign a value that is big enough in each case we want to define a value
that will be larger than anything we will be dealing with. At the same time we don't want the value too big, because
OpenScad does not render as nice for values that are too big. Since everything made in this project will be 3D
printed, and because my 3D printer has a maximum print length of about 6in I will set INF to be about an order of
magnitude bigger

Sometimes, in order for the geometry to render properly we need parts to overlap by some small amount. EPS is the
value we use whenever possible. We set it to a reasonably small value. Since we will be 3D printing these parts we
just choose a value that is smaller than the tolerance of the printer.

We want a convenient way to work in the units at the atomic scale while at the same time ending up with a reasonable
real-world scale. Since the convenient unit is the picometer (pm), we define that unit to be a scale factor, so that
if we want something that is say 120pm in length we can simply express it as 120*pm. We chose this particular scale
factor so that the Van der Waals radius of hydrogen is 10mm in real-world scale. That is 120*pm == 10,
or pm = 1/12.
We use lower case here (as opposed to the typical upper case for constants) for legibility in use.
